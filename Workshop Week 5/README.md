**How to choose chart forms?** [The Visual Vocabulary](https://github.com/ft-interactive/chart-doctor/tree/master/visual-vocabulary) by the Financial Times Data team tries to answer that question. There’s also a [website](https://ft-interactive.github.io/visual-vocabulary/) with all the chart forms. 

**How to choose data vis tools?** I wrote three articles about that topic: One in which I [tried 12 data vis apps (think drag and drop)](https://lisacharlotterost.github.io/2016/05/17/one-chart-tools/), one in which I [tried 12 charting libraries (think code)](https://lisacharlotterost.github.io/2016/05/17/one-chart-code/) and one in which I talked about that experience: [“What I Learned Recreating One Chart Using 24 Tools”](https://source.opennews.org/articles/what-i-learned-recreating-one-chart-using-24-tools/).

**What are cool interactive journalism projects out there?** This [neat Github list](https://github.com/wbkd/awesome-interactive-journalism) is full of inspiration.
